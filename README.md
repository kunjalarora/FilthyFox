## WHAT IS FilthyFox? ü¶ä
FilthyFox is a web application made to resolve conflicts over uncleanliness between housemates, while avoiding the awkwardness of confrontation. It redirects the animosity/tension from undone chores and puts all the blame on Jeremy - our eagerly confrontational - mascot. In a lighthearted way, your house is ready to be cleaner and your housemates bond strengthening!

## OUR INSPIRATION üí°
Entering adulthood brings new experiences and challenges, especially for those who move away from home. Managing household chores as an adult can be overwhelming, especially when balancing work, health, and other responsibilities. Living with roommates and delegating household tasks adds additional stress to new adults. Our web app simplifies this by acting as a household chore tracker, helping households organize, assign, and track tasks. With a clear dashboard, reminders, and progress tracking, everyone stays accountable, making shared living smoother and fairer. Our mascot Jeremy holds members accountable and takes the blame for any chore nagging, acting as a middle man, reducing the stress of confrontation and improving dynamic and ambience.

Many surveys have shown that the main issues between roommates is a lack of cleanliness and communication. In particular, a survey inquiring about negative roommate experiences, done by university students, shows that out of 31 people, 35.5% having noticed a lack of cleanliness and hygiene with 22.6% noticing poor communication and conflict resolution. Rent Research did a similar survey with 100 people and found similar results. 37% said that poor cleaning habits bothered them the most with the next habit being poor communication at 12.2%. These both show the impacts poor communication and a lack of cleanliness can have on roommates, which FilthyFox is created to resolve these issues.

## OUR TECH STACK üíª
FilthyFox was developed using Next.js to handle server-side rendering with React for building our user interface. For some of our components we used Material UI rendering within React components. Our backend is a SQLite database managed using Prisma ORM. The application was deployed through Heroku's platform with a GoDaddy-provided domain. Git and GitHub were used for version control during development.
THE FUTURE OF FilthyFox üí´
In the future, we plan to allow for a larger and more secure database to store user information in. We also plan to scale the project into a full platform for tracking roommate spending and finances aspects like having to share groceries and bills, to organize communal tasks effectively.

## CHALLENGES üèÜ
This hackathon was the first hackathon for many of our members, so some of us did not have experience with many of the frameworks we used! We often ran into bugs and found several features that needed to be implemented that we had not thought of before. A big issue we had was deploying the project. We chose to use SQLite for our database, and did not realize until later on that this would prevent us from having a working product deployed since SQLite data does not persist. This led to a large amount of time spent on trying to deploy our data in other ways (like PostgreSQL), which we ultimately did not have time for but would love to complete in the future.
